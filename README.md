# ToDo-Exercise
We created a todo list in react that allows the user to add and remove items from the list.  We also styled the app to be more pleasing to the eye.

##To Run
1. Download the files in this repository.
2. Then you will need to upload them to your local server in order to view them.
3. Alternatively you can open the folder in VS code and launch from there to a browser.

##Future Improvements
I would like to add more styling and possibly more features.
